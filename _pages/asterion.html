        Asterion is an open source project that aims at outlining subgroups of all major <a target="_blank" href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/groups.html">near-Earth asteroid groups</a> with high concentration of potentially hazardous in them. The process of discovering boundaries of these subgroups is based on the application of machine learning techniques to mine asteroid database and group together potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) by their orbital parameters. The ensemble of these subgroups provides a unique insight into the possible residences of yet undiscovered PHAs.

        <p class="research-info">
        The asteroid database mining approach proposed in this work produces subgroups with high PHA purity (~90%) that together contain ~90 % of all real and hypothetical PHAs. Obtained results can be useful for planning future PHA discovery surveys or asteroid-hunting space missions.

        The project was initiated at NASA Space Apps Challenge global hackathon in April 2016 and the team <a target="_blank" href="{{site.projects.asterion-cya}}">Asterion-CYA</a> became a global finalist in the nomination “Best use of data”.
