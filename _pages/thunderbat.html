        Thunderbat is a concept of a stealthy supersonic UAV-fighter. It is able to carry an air bomb, cruise missile or a set of air-to air missiles and is equipped with two light turbofan engines with variable-area nozzles.

        <p class="research-info">
        Main feature of the Thunderbat is its low radar visibility. It is designed in best traditions of stealth warplanes and has low radar cross section (RCS) from the bottom hemisphere. A huge wing area allows it to deliver heavy missiles closer to the battle field without being detected. All outer elements are profiled to minimize backscattering, including coupled air inlet and engines' afterburners.

        The afterburners are placed above the fuselage at some distance from the tail. It allows reducing the thermal trail of the engines' exhaust that passes above the elevators.
