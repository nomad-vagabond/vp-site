        Stribog (a Slavic god of wind) is a concept of a heavy unmanned aircraft-based space launch system. It is capable of delivering medium-lift launch vehicles (LV) to the altitudes of 10-11 km and provides a smooth hot separation at the ascending launch maneuver phase of the flight.

        <!-- A maximal payload mass of the carrier aircraft is estimated in the range of 160-180 tons. -->
       It is designed to carry launch vehicles with mass of 160-180 tons and maximal diameter of 5 meters. It means it can provide air launch capability to a wide range of existing multistage medium-lift LVs with solid or liquid propellant components.

        <p class="research-info">
        The carrier aircraft has a wingspan of 60 meters and propelled by 4 powerful turbofan engines. The central placement of the large LV requires two-beam scheme of the carrier. Stribog's two symmetric narrow fuselage beams have reduced mass and low aerodynamic drag. Tis is possible due to the unmanned flight control scheme of the carrier aircraft and thus - by eliminating the need in cockpits and life support systems.

        <p class="research-info">
        The launch from carrier aircraft allows to reduce the cost of placing heavy satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO) and to increase the maximal payload mass of the launch vehicles. Moreover, it can be the best option for the countries without their own spaceports.
