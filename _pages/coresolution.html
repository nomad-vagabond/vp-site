        CoreSolution is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> library for construction, simplification and solving nonlinear systems of equations. It mixes the powers of symbolic and numeric computations and provides a high-level insight to the problem. CoreSolution is designed to simplify and speed up the process of problem comprehension and formalization. 
        </p>

        <p class="research-info">
        CoreSolution uses <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a> to handle symbolic operations connected to the equation systems' construction and simplification. Systems can be constructed from the objects that encapsulate equations related to them, from the lists of separate equations or both. This approach simplifies analysis of the relationships between models of the real-world or abstract objects. The software enables automatic reduction of equations by finding independent and eliminating other variables.

        CoreSolution provides the ability to convert symbolic systems of equations into the Python functions in order to apply numeric solvers. It uses <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> to solve determined systems numerically or to apply parametric sweep for the undetermined systems.

        The project is at its early stage of development but already has a sufficient functionality to deal with large systems of equations. The code can be accessed at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nomad-vagabond/CoreSolution">GitHub</a>.
