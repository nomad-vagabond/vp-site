        IcySplines is a software for data fitting with splines. It is inspired by such data acquisition and curve fitting tools as <a href="http://www.jcprg.org/gsys/">Gsys </a>, <a href="https://www.curveexpert.net/"> CurveExpert</a>, <a href="http://www.oakdaleengr.com/datafit.htm"> DataFit </a> and a few others. IcySplines aims at integrating basic capabilities of the mentioned tools and makes an accent on the use of splines for curve fitting. </p>
