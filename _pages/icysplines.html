        IcySplines is a software for data fitting with splines. It is inspired by such data acquisition and curve fitting tools as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jcprg.org/gsys/">Gsys</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.curveexpert.net/">CurveExpert</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oakdaleengr.com/datafit.htm">DataFit</a> and a few others. IcySplines aims at integrating basic capabilities of the mentioned tools and makes an accent on the use of splines for curve fitting. </p>

        The software allows to extract data from images and tables and provides a set of tools for interpolation and approximation with spline functions and parametric spline curves. It is written in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> with the use of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro">PyQt</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>.
