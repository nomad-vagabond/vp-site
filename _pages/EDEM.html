        EDEM (Europa Direct Encounter Mission) is a concept of a landing mission to Europa – one of the Jupiter’s icy moons.

        It is believed that Europa may be a habitable world. This is possible due to the suggestion that a giant salt water ocean exists beneath the ice crust of Europa. The thickness of the ice crust is estimated in the range of 3…30 km.

        <p class="research-info">
          There exist several concepts of the Europa ice penetration, mainly based on the drilling or ice-melting principles. On the contrary to these concepts EDEM is focused on a kinetic ice penetration. The mission concept is based on the application of an ultra-strong momentum exchange tether that is used for efficient deceleration of the Europa landing module and acceleration of the ice-penetration assets.

        The long-lasting angular acceleration of the tethered spacecraft is provided by a pair of electric thrusters. The acceleration phase lasts during the interplanetary flight, while the energy is provided by solar panels and onboard radioisotope generator of the landing module.

        <p class="research-info">
        The project is at its early phase. The preliminary concept with details on a flight scheme and  spacecraft layout will be presented at IAC 2017 in Adelaide, Australia.
