        RACROSSER is an integrated software that enables calculation of Radar Cross Section for objects of arbitrary shapes and materials. Software consists of:</p>
        <ul class="shifted">
             <li>preprocessor that allows to load mesh and specify input parameters;</li>
             <li>multiprocessing computational core, based on the approach of physical optics complemented with physical theory of diffraction concepts;</li>
             <li>postprocessor for rendering results.</li>
         </ul>

        <p class="research-info">
        Software is written in Python (with the use of Qt, OpenGL and Matplotlib). Some heavy computational routines are ported to C++.
