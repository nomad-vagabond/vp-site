      My research activity is scattered over a vast range of topics. 
      The first deep study of mine was connected to the development of a method and a corresponding algorithm for computation of the microwave scattering characteristics of electrically large objects with arbitrary shape and surface materials. The developed asymptotic method is based on the approach of physical optics, complemented with the concept of edge currents (Ufimtsev’s physical theory of diffraction). Since 2014 I’m leading the research connected to the Space Elevator and its systems at Yuzhnoye SDO (Ukraine). My work in this direction helped me in becoming a member of the IAA Study Group “Road to Space Elevator Era”. Participation in NASA Space Apps Challenge 2016 has given me a unique opportunity in maintaining my skills in the area of machine learning and initiating a research devoted to the prediction of orbital parameters for undiscovered potentially hazardous asteroids. My most recent endeavor is related to the conceptual design of a future landing mission to Europa (icy moon of Jupiter) with application of momentum exchange tether. Results of this study will be presented at IAC 2017.

      Besides the space-related issues I’m interested in design and engineering automation and knowledge management, including generative design and knowledge-based engineering. These interests pushed me forward initiating two projects: IcySplines (data fitting with splines) and CoreSolution (construction, simplification and solving nonlinear systems of equations).

        <strong>Abstract</strong> The purpose of this study is to make a prediction of combinations of orbital parameters for yet undiscovered potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) with the use of machine learning algorithms. The proposed approach aims at outlining subgroups of all major groups of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) with high concentration of PHAs in them. The approach is designed to obtain meaningful results and easy-understandable boundaries of the PHA subgroups in 2- and 3-dimensional subspaces of orbital parameters. Boundaries of these PHA subgroups were found mainly by the use of Support Vector Machines algorithm with RBF kernel. Additional datasets of virtual asteroids were generated to handle sufficient amount of training and test data, as well as to emulate undiscovered asteroids. This synthetic data helped in revealing ‘XX’-shaped region with high concentration of PHAs in the (ω, q) plane. Boundaries of this region were used to split all NEAs into several domains. For each domain the subgroups of PHAs were outlined in different subspaces of orbital parameters. Extracted subgroups have high PHA purity (~90%) and contain ~90% of all real and virtual PHAs. Obtained results can be useful for planning future PHA discovery surveys or asteroid-hunting space missions.

        <strong>Abstract</strong> Nowadays, all prerequisites exist to assume that construction of space elevator is realizable in the near  future. Meanwhile, no technologically mature way of the strength-sufficient material production has been achieved, but  it only gives humanity more time for the conceptual research in other areas of space elevator design. This paper tries to embrace several main issues, connected with space elevator design, operation and maintenance. 
        A range of possible solutions to these issues is proposed. Amongst them: tether length decrease by the means of the counterweight mass increase using space debris, tether tapering optimization, electric powering of climbers in atmosphere and powerbeaming in space, High Stage One alternatives.

        <h2> Open library for space elevator design and engineering. Analyses of tether tapering functions </h2>

        <strong>Abstract</strong> Tapering of a space elevator’s tether from the planet surface to the altitude of the synchronous orbit and further to the counterweight altitude can reduce the mass of the whole system, as well as provide more or less even distribution of stress along the tether rather than in the case of using uniform tether. This document presents the analyses of some tether tapering functions and shows that exponentially tapered tether is not an optimal solution for the space elevator with climbers or other point loads like transitional stations. To handle these analyses ClarkeLib – an open library for calculation of basic space elevator parameters and loads has been developed. Estimation of Earth Elevator and Mars Elevator parameters has been made using this library, and results are represented in this paper.
